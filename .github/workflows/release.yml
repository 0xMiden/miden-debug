# Our release workflow is as follows:
#
# 1. Merging to `main` will create a new release PR containing any unreleased changes
# 2. The release PR gets merged to `main` when we are ready to publish the release
# 3. The crates are published to crates.io, a new git tag is created, as well as a GitHub release
# 4. A job is run to pre-build the executable for our supported targets and upload them to the
#    release.
