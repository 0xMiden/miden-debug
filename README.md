# Miden Debugger

This repo provides the implementation of the `miden debug` command, i.e. an interactive debugger for Miden programs.

The underlying `miden-debug` crate may also be used as a library, for use cases where you want to use the debugger as an executor for Miden programs, such as
in tests, etc.

See the [documentation](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/tree/next/docs/external/src/guides/debugger.md) for more details on the `miden debug` command, and how to use the debugger.
